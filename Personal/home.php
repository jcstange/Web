         	Hi there! Welcome to My Page! <br/>
			</p>
			<p id="texto2"><br/> 
			I've been working for a while with some personal developments, so I've made this webpage to share a bit of my work as developer and give life to some ideas.<br/><br/>
			
			How rude I am! I didn't introduce myself. I'm Joao, 30 years old, curious men that researchs about everything, addicted on music, caffeine and - for sure - information. <br/><br/>
			
			
			Guitar player since I was 12, I always been intrigated with the effect pedals and the kind of waves that it produced. I decided to study electrinic engineering. <br/><br/>

			
			My interest in IoT and Robotics started when I got a scientifical scholarship in 2009 to work with NI Labview in a project to develop a goniophotometer 'C' for tests with lamps and luminaires, controlling servos and using RS-232 communication with the lux sensor. In the next year I've been hired as engineering intern to develop a monitor for electrical life tests for contactors, switches and switch-breakers up to 13800 V.<br/><br/>

			After graduation I started to work for Toshiba as a Project Manager building electrical substations, and as a Proposal Engineer developing proposal for biddings. In the mean time, as a hobbist, I started to develop simple embedded systems using MCU and Raspberry GPIO. <br/><br/>
			
			At some point the hobbie took place, I left Toshiba's job and started to develop a home automation system with a friend. The project wasn't profitable because we were selling prototypes, and there wasn't sponsor. So make some money, I start to develop websites and e-commerces.<br/><br/>
			
			A received a proposal to works for the Europe Assistance Group to develop automative trackers and a set of tools using GPRS, GPS and Accelerometers. I worked there per 10 months when I received a invitation from a Finnish friend to spend a time in Finland.<br/><br/>

			Nowadays I'm in Finland studying computer graphics in Aalto University and looking for an opportunity to internationalize my career.<br><br></p>
